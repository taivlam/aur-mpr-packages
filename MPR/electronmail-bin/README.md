# `electronmail-bin`

This MPR [package](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/electronmail-bin#package-details)
is for [ElectronMail](https://github.com/vladimiry/ElectronMail), a third-party
desktop client for Proton Mail that is cross-platform (available for Windows,
macOS, and Linux) and is based on [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)).

## Maintaining this MPR package
I will maintain ElectronMail for as long as upstream ElectronMail is maintained.

However, as of February 2024, Proton Tech [officially](https://proton.me/support/mail-desktop-app)
has its own native Proton Mail desktop client in beta for Windows and macOS.

Allegedly, Linux support will eventually be release, first via early access and
then publicly available.

However, here's my opinion: at the rate at which Proton Tech's software
engineering moves, I'll still keep using ElectronMail until the official Proton
Mail desktop client for Linux is released for both APT-based distros and
Pacman-based Linux distros (likely through the AUR, similarly to Proton VPN).

I will keep track of progress on Proton Mail's desktop client for Linux.

## Thanks
Thanks to the prior maintainer, [@hiddeninthesand](https://github.com/hiddeninthesand),
for starting this package.
