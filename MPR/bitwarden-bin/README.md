# `bitwarden-bin`

Coming soon...

## Notes
* Official `.deb` archive from Bitwarden's official download [page](https://bitwarden.com/download/) lack auto-updates

## To do
Not a good [practice](https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/todo-zero/), but I do want to make this sooner rather than later

* Use checksums: SHA256, SHA512, or BLAKE2/`b2sum`
