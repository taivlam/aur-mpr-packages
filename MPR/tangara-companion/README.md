## Background info

This is the MPR package, built from source, for the
[Tangara Companion](https://github.com/haileys/tangara-companion) desktop
application.

[Tangara](https://cooltech.zone/tangara/) is an open-source software and
open-source hardware music player from [Cool Tech Zone](https://cooltech.zone/).
Tangara launched a successful crowdsourcing [campaign](https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara)
on [Crowd Supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_Supply) in 2024.

In order to obtain newer firmware for Tangara devices, users will need to
[flash firmware](https://cooltech.zone/tangara/docs/flashing/) onto the device.
The recommended way for most users is to use the Tangara Companion desktop app.

Info about the Tangara Companion app will be updated accordingly, as not all
users haven't received their Tangara devices from the initial batch of devices.
