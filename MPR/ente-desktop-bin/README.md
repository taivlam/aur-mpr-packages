## About
[Ente](https://ente.io/) first started out making a client for end-to-end
encrypted photo storage.  Currently, code for both client and server code is
open-source.  This is its desktop client on APT-based Linux distros.  The
creators of Ente Photos also created [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/).

## Scope
I will maintain this package until Ente officially support an automatically
updating method (such as a third-party APT repository) for Debian/Ubuntu.
