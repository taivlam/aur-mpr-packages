# `proton-mail-bin`

## About
[Proton Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Mail) is the e-mail service
of [Proton AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_AG).  This is official
Proton Mail desktop client for Debian/Ubuntu on the MPR.

## Maintainer metadata
* Architecture: `amd64` only
* No first-party checksums provided, so the following are used:
    * BLAKE2/`b2sum`
    * SHA512
        * Used by `proton-mail-bin` on the AUR, which uses the DEB archive
    * SHA256
* [MPR page](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/proton-mail-bin)
* Official Proton Mail [download page](https://proton.me/mail/download)

## Scope
I will maintain this until Proton makes an auto-updating method for its Linux
client on Debian/Ubuntu.
