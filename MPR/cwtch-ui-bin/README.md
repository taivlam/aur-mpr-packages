## Context and background info

Cwtch is a decentralized and metadata resistant E2EE communication app designed
by [Open Privacy Research Society](https://openprivacy.ca/).  The desktop UI
application is what users will use to communicate over Cwtch.  (On the other
hand, the `cwtch` software is the [software](https://git.openprivacy.ca/cwtch.im/cwtch)
for the Cwtch protocol.)  Cwtch also uses [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)).

Its source code [repo](https://git.openprivacy.ca/cwtch.im/cwtch-ui) is on
[Gitea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitea).
