## Background

I became aware of [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/) after watching a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxRXiL3oI6Q) about the application.

## Maintenance scope
I will maintain this package as long as there is a lack of an official method
that automatically updates the package on Debian- or Ubuntu-based Linux
distributions.
